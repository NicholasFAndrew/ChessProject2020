# ChessProject2020
Chess Project from Intermediate C++ Grossmont College


This project was an excercise in extensive use and manipulation of class based actions. There were a few changes 
that I believe could have been done to improve and streamline my code, such as assigning commonly used strings their own
varaible as to allow for more flexible editting, but I believe it was a good example of mastery of class based coding.
